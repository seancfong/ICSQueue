# ICS Queue :fast_forward: 

ICS Queue is a virtual queue system. It allows students to join a first-come first-serve queue and get notified when it's their turn to be helped.

By using the `onShapshot` feature with Firebase, users can get real-time updates with the database without having to refresh their pages.

### 4. Tutors and Admins can select a queue and see who is currently being served.

- The students show up in increasing order (position 1 represents the next student in line and the bottom number represents a student who just subscribed to the queue.)
- Admins can remove any student from the queue, if necessary (although in practice, the top students should be removed).

### 5. Tutors and Admins can delete a queue when lab sessions end, so that they can generate a new room in following ones.

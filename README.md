# ICS Queue

ICS Queue is a virtual queue system built using Next.JS, Typescript, TailwindCSS, and Firebase. It allows students to join a queue and get notified when it's their turn to be served.

The site can be found [live over here](https://ics-queue.vercel.app).

By using the `onShapshot` feature with Firebase, users can get real-time updates with the database without having to refresh their pages.

## Features

### 1. Students can join the queue by entering their Full Name and Room Code, which could be randomly generated by tutors or admins.

### 2. Students can see their position in the queue.

- Students receive a notification when it's their turn to be served.

### 4. Tutors and Admins can select a queue and see who is currently being served.

- The students show up in increasing order (position 1 represents the next student in line and the bottom number represents a student who just subscribed to the queue.)
- Admins can remove any student from the queue, if necessary (although in practice, the top students should be removed).

### 5. Tutors and Admins can delete a queue when lab sessions end, so that they can generate a new room in following ones.
